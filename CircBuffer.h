/** Circular Buffer of elements of class T. One reader and one writer may work in parallel. Reader is using
  * only BeingRead index, and writer only BeingWritten, so index can be screwed-up ONLY when cross-used,
  * like in Clear()
  * NOTE: When both BeingRead and BeingWritten refer the same block the buffer is empty, as this block is
  * not written yet, so there is nothing to read
  * NOTE: Writing and reading function DO NOT CHECK WHETHER THERE IS SPACE! THEY NEVER RETURN
  * NULLPTR. Call LeftTo... function beforehand
  * NOTE: the size of CircBuffer is powers of 2 to avoid conditional rollovers (when we compare
  * index with an end of buffer all the time
  * @tparam tSize - type of size variable, if sizeLog2 is not specified determines the size of buffer, which
  * is maximum value which can fit into this type
  * @tparam sizeLog2 - Log2 of desired size in bytes. Sizes of this buffer are powers of two
   * and we do not want to make virtual functions
