 * this is CircBuffer class which allows to read entries by continues blocks. It still writes one by one
 * @note as CurrentBuffer??? classes this class is not virtual, so if you override one function you have to override
 * every function which relies on it, otherwise superclass versions will be called. VirtCircBuffer.h implements
 * CircBuffer class with virtual classes
 * @tparam CircBufferClass - may be any of CircBuffer??? classes
